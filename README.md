# AI-based HER2 Scoring for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This repository contains the code and saved models of my thesis project on improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Abstract

Breast cancer still remains at the top among all the cancers that af-
fect women across the globe. Early detection by accurate diagnosis
is the key to successful treatment and to increasing survival. Despite
the diagnostic methods used are effective, they have some limitations
because of the variability in the outcome due to human error and
subjectivity. In this dissertation, I explore the application of artifi-
cial intelligence and machine learning to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of diagnosing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) status for breast cancer patients. HER2 is a protein whose
overexpression relates to more aggressive types of breast cancer and
less favorable prognoses. Accurate HER2 status assessment is crucial
in guiding treatment decisions, especially with the advent of targeted
treatment approaches, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin). Traditional
assessment of HER2 status has been done through Immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), both of
which have a high degree of variability and require extended time
and pathologist expertise. This project aims to assess the potential
of AI-based HER2 scoring using machine learning algorithms on the
analysis of digitized pathology images. A model that automatically
classifies HER2 scores, having learned from a dataset of annotated
IHC images, using convolutional neural networks for feature extrac-
tion and classification to reduce subjectivity and improve consistency
in HER2 assessment is proposed in this research.

## Repository Contents

- **Code**: In the repository are available some of the Jupiter notebooks that i'm working on.


## Results

I am still working on my thesis, but the first results showed an accuracy of 94% at classification HER2 scores.
