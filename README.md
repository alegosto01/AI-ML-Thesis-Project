# AI-based HER2 Scoring for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This repository contains the code and saved models of my thesis project on improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Abstract

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for successful treatment and increasing survival rates. Despite the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods, they have limitations due to variability in outcomes caused by human error and subjectivity.

In this dissertation, I explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing HER2 status for breast cancer patients. HER2 is a protein associated with more aggressive breast cancer types and less favorable prognoses. Accurate HER2 status assessment is essential for guiding treatment decisions, especially with targeted treatments like trastuzumab (Herceptin).

Traditional methods for assessing HER2 status, such as Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), are variable, time-consuming, and require expert pathologist interpretation. This project aims to evaluate the potential of AI-based HER2 scoring using machine learning algorithms on digitized pathology images.

The proposed model automatically classifies HER2 scores by learning from a dataset of annotated IHC images, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. This approach aims to reduce subjectivity and improve consistency in HER2 assessment.

## Results

I am still working on my thesis, but the first results showed an accuracy of 94% at classification HER2 scores.
